## Summary
A quick run-through of setting up a lab from scratch, an overview of cookies and their potential pitfalls and security risks, and a delineation of the
login-and-password handling creation process, moving from the most basic login process possible (starting from no user-authentication at all) to 
increasing levels of security and complexity that we've seen in some of the previous labs. Briefly touches upon database interactions and the difference
between renders and redirects.
